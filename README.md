# Pair Review System Demo

## Project Overview
This is a simple Pair Review System implemented as a website. Each participant submits their assignment and reviews the partner's work via GitHub Pull Requests. The final website displays both assignments.

## Participants & Roles
- **Oluwadamilola (Dev):** Sets up repo, HTML/CSS, manages branches, merges Pull Requests
- **Partner (Non-dev):** Writes assignment content, tests website, reviews PRs

## Workflow
1. Each participant creates a branch (e.g., `branch-yourname`, `branch-partnername`)  
2. Add assignment content in `index.html` under the proper section  
3. Open Pull Request to merge changes into `main`  
4. Partner reviews PR using GitHub comments  
5. Author makes changes if necessary and merges PR  
6. Final website shows both assignments

## Instructions
- Replace the placeholder text in `index.html` with actual assignment content  
- Commit and push your branch to GitHub
