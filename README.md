# Pair Review System Demo

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Pair Review System using GitHub branches and Pull Requests. Two contributors collaborate on a single website by submitting and reviewing each other’s work before merging changes into the main branch.

## Participants & Roles
- **Oluwadamilola (Developer):** Project setup, HTML/CSS structure, branch management, and Pull Request reviews
- **Partner (Content Contributor):** Writes assigned content, updates designated sections, and participates in Pull Request reviews

## Workflow
1. Each contributor creates a separate branch (e.g., `branch-oluwadamilola`, `branch-partner`)  
2. Contributors add or update content in their assigned section of `index.html`  
3. A Pull Request is opened to merge changes into the `main` branch  
4. The other contributor reviews the Pull Request and provides feedback using GitHub comments  
5. Revisions are made if necessary, and the Pull Request is merged  
6. The final website reflects the reviewed contributions from both participants

## Usage Instructions
- Clone or fork the repository  
- Create a new branch for your contribution  
- Update only your assigned section in `index.html`  
- Commit and push changes to GitHub  
- Open a Pull Request and review your partner’s submission
